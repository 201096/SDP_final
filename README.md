# SDP_final


This project is assumed for Shoe_Store that provides online shopping to all the customers. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

Our team decided to work with the project topic of online sneakers store. We included some new features for our clients. The project was divided among 3 persons, so each of us was responsible for different parts of the project. Our work was aimed to engage all the possible features of online stores, so we managed to create special database for products and clients. In addition, we created some special supplies as for example, our clients could get the premium account to have special discount and vouchers, and for those who want to get the temporary access for the week to get some assumption codes and discounts due to the holidays proposals we prepared special promocodes. Thus, those clients who does not want to buy premium account can get temporary access for discounts through special promos.  

As it prepared, we provide Announcements like giving free promo trials for limited amount of people using Announcement Part. And as it is clearly seen we are working basically for good communication with clients.

6)  Strategy pattern (create order payment types , like via debit card, VISA or cash)

TEAM MEMBERS: 
Our team consists of three members: Daniyar Issenov, Farabi Samalykov, Bekzhan Lesbek. The project had been divided among us like: Daniyar’s responsibility: create classes for decorator pattern for order payments and singleton pattern for clients description, complete proposal.  Farabi’s responsibility: use classes for observer pattern to create announcement part and implement adopter pattern for vip customers and temporary submissions clients using corresponding classes. Bekzhan’s responsibility: create entire sneakers products  using factory method and engage database with the clients. 
Overall, we managed to work in a team so we overcome all confusing troubles helping each other. Of course project realization process summons a lot of new agencies, that is why our final work could have some minor differences, but we had to finish our project final work completely as it was planned.
